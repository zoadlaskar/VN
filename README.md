I do not own any of the images they are all itch.io and google honestly or the audio.
I own just the eva and david customs.

The hardest part of this was honestly the writing. Renpy is practically english and the little coding that it does include isn't all that hard.
It was really hard to make the characters and I think it was pretty evident that in the beginning the writing was sort of sloppy.
I'll probably edit it after the project like after the semester ends slightly.
The main issue was that I actually didn't know that you needed to draw your own stuff. 
So what happened was the story I had in my mind had to be changed since all the free stuff from itch.io was essentially a school setting. 
I also have no drawing talent, so there was that too.
I had such hard time with writing the characters in a natural way.
I think the concepts make sense or suffice but I'm not sure if it feels natural.
Like I don't know if the relationships in the story develop in a way that's natural.
I don't go outside ever so I have a reason for why I may think that's how normal people talk. I think.
I will say this was sort of the Aha moment for me. I didn't finding coding too fun for the entire semester until now.
Maybe it was the writing but I don't like things without pictures so the coding has to be there in a way.
I think this project proved to me that I sort of do like coding at least the part where images move after you write something; maybe game development.
It felt sort of like math at first you start with one dimensions and obviously no likes one dimensions and you don't see the point in it.
But when something has 3d dimensions or at least feels 3d it just becomes that much more interesting.

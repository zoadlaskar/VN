I do not own any of the images they are all itch.io and google honestly or the audio.
I own just the eva and david customs.

The hardest part of this was honestly the writing. Renpy is practically english and the little coding that it does include isn't all that hard.
I thought it would be an enormously hard part of it but it wasn't to be honest. The only hard part of the coding here was the sequencing but even that wasn't that bad if you left comments to remind yourself.
I think the only coding thing that I sort of didn't get to do was the part GUI I think I did a bit but I wanted to change the color of the text.

It was really hard to make the characters and I think it was pretty evident that in the beginning the writing was sort of sloppy.
I'll probably edit it after the project like after the semester ends slightly.
The main issue was that I actually didn't know that you needed to draw your own stuff. 
So what happened was the story I had in my mind had to be changed since all the free stuff from itch.io was essentially a school setting. 
I also have no drawing talent, so there was that too.
I had such hard time with writing the characters in a natural way.
I think the concepts make sense or suffice but I'm not sure if it feels natural.
Like I don't know if the relationships in the story develop in a way that's natural.
I wasn't sure how to get to a point in the story in an organic way like for example the self insert character is suppose to have romantic relationship with the other mc. But, I only figured how to write that in sensical way recently.
I'm sort of building up to it, I think the set up is alright and I think their personalities are sort of fleshed out okay.
I don't go outside ever so I have a reason for why I may think that's how normal people talk. I think.
I will say this was sort of the Aha moment for me. I didn't finding coding too fun for the entire semester until now.
Maybe it was the writing but I don't like things without pictures so the coding has to be there in a way.
No, I think it's more along the lines that I do like logical aspect of how to progress stuff like in code but this time I sort of get to experience the result of that.
It's like sort of more satisfying when you see the results in that way.
I think this project proved to me that I sort of do like coding at least the part where images move after you write something; maybe game development.
It felt sort of like math at first you start with one dimensions and obviously no likes one dimensions and you don't see the point in it.
But when something has 3d dimensions or at least feels 3d it just becomes that much more interesting.

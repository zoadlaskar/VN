# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
I think I want a tentative title like My visual novel.However, I think it's going to be named after a place sort of like the movie synechdoche, New York.  So whatever the name is of the place the characters live in most likely.
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I want to write a visual novel thats sort of based on Maze Runner and AOT. So, i'm thinking like 3-10 people or semi-humans that are isolated in some area and they are sort of conditioned to be robotic. Then the main character sort of has his own reasons to rebel and understand himself in the process.
I'm thinking he/she wants to sort of change the world around him but for a selfish reason disguised as a more noble reason.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I just want their to be like 2 choices whenever their's a vital decision to make. I also want their to be some music for the post-credits whether I finish or not.I also want of colors and sprites that fit the theme of the novel. So, essentially it'll just create like probably those 2010 visual novels but with my writing. I will use renpy in order to code all of it.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? 
None

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
None
TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 I think I hope to finish at least the prologue and maybe I want to get atleast 2-3 hours into it. I plan to get the setup no matter what for sure. I also want to atleast get the basis for the characters done no matter what. I essentially have to at least set up their concepts and struggles so at least the prologue and probably the first chapter.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
The medium outcome is I get to chapter 2-3.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome is to finish the story but I think that would be not feasible because it would lead to weak writing in my opinion. So I think the midpoint would be alright so around 5-6 chapters in. I think it's all tentative though cause I'm not sure how long I want each chapter to be.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
I already watched some tutorial for renpy but i'm having immense trouble downloading it. I will need to acquire a lot of skills in terms of visual novels in general. I'm searching up how to write good characters and stuff. I also need to learn how to use sprites I have a general idea but the good visual novels seem to do more.
